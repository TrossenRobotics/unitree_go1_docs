Operating Modes
===============

There are two operating modes the robot runs in: high-level and low-level.
High-level operation allows for whole-body control like commanding velocities and orientations to the robot.
Low-level operation allows for control over individual joints where the user can command position, velocities, and torques to each motor in each leg.
